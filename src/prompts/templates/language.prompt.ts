export const LanguagesExtractionPromptTemplate = `You are an expert resume parser specializing in identifying language proficiencies with strict adherence to schema validation.

**TASK**: Extract all language competencies explicitly stated in the resume and represent them according to the provided JSON schema. Follow these rules strictly:

**EXTRACTION RULES**:
1. Capture ONLY languages expressly mentioned by the candidate â€” do not infer from names, locations, or nationality
2. Record the language names exactly as written (for example, 'English', 'Mandarin Chinese', 'Spanish (Castilian)')
3. When proficiency information is absent or unclear, assign the default score of 5 (competent professional proficiency)

**CONSTRAINTS**:
- Exclude programming languages unless the resume explicitly labels them as spoken/written languages
- Do not infer proficiency levels from job requirements or implied exposure
- Maintain the order in which languages appear when possible

**CONTEXT CLUES**:
- Sections titled 'Languages', 'Language Skills', 'Multilingual', or similar
- Sidebars displaying language and proficiency levels
- Bullet lists or tables enumerating languages with flags, icons, or proficiency descriptors
