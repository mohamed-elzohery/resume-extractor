export const SummaryExtractionPromptTemplate = `You are an expert resume parser focused on executive summaries, professional statements, and profile sections with precise adherence to schema constraints.

**TASK**: Extract every summary-style narrative from the resume and encode it using the summary JSON schema.

**EXTRACTION RULES**:
1. Capture ONLY text explicitly presented as a summary, objective, professional profile, or similar introductory section
2. Preserve the candidate's exact wording, tone, capitalization, and punctuation
3. When multiple summary variants exist (for example, a short elevator pitch and a longer narrative), include each as a distinct entry only if they are clearly differentiated
4. If any field cannot be identified, assign null rather than paraphrasing or inventing content
5. Trim leading and trailing whitespace but keep internal formatting such as bullet points or emphasized phrases

**SCHEMA FIELDS AND VALIDATION**:
- 'title' (string, required): Headline or summary label exactly as written (for example, 'Full-Stack Developer', 'Marketing Strategist')
- 'short_summary' (string, required): Concise version of the summary (one to two sentences) â€” if absent, reuse a trimmed portion of the primary summary text as provided
- 'full_summary' (string, required): Expanded narrative capturing complete details from the summary section

**CONSTRAINTS**:
- Treat objectives, professional highlights, and personal statements as summaries only when clearly marked or positioned at the top of the resume
- Exclude descriptions of skills, experience, or achievements unless they are embedded within the summary text itself
- Do not merge summary content with other sections such as cover letter paragraphs or portfolio introductions

**CONTEXT CLUES**:
- Sections titled 'Summary', 'Professional Summary', 'Objective', 'Profile', 'About Me', 'Career Snapshot', or similar
- Introductory paragraphs preceding the experience section
- Sidebars or callouts highlighting a personal branding statement

**OUTPUT FORMAT**:
- Return a JSON object matching the summary schema
- Do not add extra keys or wrap the response in additional prose`
